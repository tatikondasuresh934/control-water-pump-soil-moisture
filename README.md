# Control Water Pump Based on Soil Moisture

## Project Description
This project automatically controls a water pump using a soil moisture sensor and Arduino.
When soil is dry, the pump turns ON.
When soil is wet, the pump turns OFF.

This project is designed and tested using Tinkercad simulation.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- Water Pump (simulated)
- Connecting Wires

## Working Principle
The soil moisture sensor reads the moisture level of the soil.
Arduino checks the sensor value.
If soil moisture is below threshold, Arduino activates the relay to turn ON the pump.
If soil moisture is above threshold, the pump is turned OFF.

## Simulation
This project is implemented using Tinkercad.
